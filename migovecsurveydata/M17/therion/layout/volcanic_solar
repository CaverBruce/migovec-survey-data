Volcanic eruptions and climate (quite short)

Sulphate spike. Not so many particles.

Bruhnes Matuyama reversal. Caldera still there. 

TOBA, SANTORINI 1650 BC collapse of civilisation, TAMBORA year without summer

PINATUBO

PAGES-2k, tree-ring data. Forcing based on aerosols from Volcanoes.
Sigl et al 2015 cooling, 
Persistance of up to 10 years, but proportional to the magnitude of the eruptions.
Depends on the location of the volcano and the season of the eruption.


Solar forcing.
Controversial topics, since the climatoseptics, interesting forcing agents? It is a minefield.
Coronal mass ejection, felt 8 mins later by satellites.
Schwabe Cycle
Hale Cycle
Gleissberg Cycle
2300yr Hallstatt Cycle
Wolf Minimum, Sp√∂rer, Maunder Minimum.
Cosmic radiation as a proxy for solar activity?
An interesting one there.

Cosmic rays have nothing to do with the sun. Solar Wind interacts with magnetic field.
Only during the mass ejections are cosmic rays produced by the Sun.

Supernovae explosions, black holes and neutron stars, constant flux of these particles.

Flux modulated by Solar activity and Earth's magnetic field.
