## M16 entrance to Mona tip -- NCB

### M16 Entrance to Brezno Strahov

The M16 entrance series starts with a descending belly-crawl leading to a window on left into a rigged pitch.
The entrance pitch is loose in places and care should be taken traversing at the top of the final hang of this pitch.
At the bottom, a boulder- and cobble-floored chamber, the way on is up a short 3 m pitch into a window on the opposite side of the landing.
This leads immediately to another short pitch and at the bottom, a short traverse over a 10 m drop.
On the far side, another pitch leads to a constriction popping out into a chamber with large fallen blocks on the floor.
The way on is on the far side, to a narrow down-climb into a the start of another roped section.
Soon, the head of the 30 m deep Brezno Stahov pit is reached.


### Brezno Strahov to Hotline
At the bottom of _Brezno Strahov_, the way on is down a steep boulder slope to another constricted pitch head.
The short 6 m drop leads into a passage breaking into a large chamber ahead. _Following the ropes downward at this point leads towards the branch of_ Galaktika _chamber_.
Ignoring this and following an immediate up-pitch, the large, draughty walking size _Hotline_ passage is reached, where fallen blocks and boulders are covered with a distinctive black deposit.
Entering this passage, the way on is downwards (to the left upon arrival by climbing up the rope).

### Hotline to Mig Country
Heading down _Hotline_ soon, a down-climb to the right reaches the start of short traverse over a 10 m pit, after which the passage starts to descend more steeply.
At the next enlargement of the gallery, a set of ropes can be descended to a rock-bridge in the middle of a large space.
This is _Gladiator's Traverse_. On the far side of the rock-bridge, it is possible to climb back up and follow the ropes to another traverse of a large void, _Mig Country_.
The first part of the traverse ends with a 10 m pitch up to a junction.
Onwards leads to the main gallery of _Level_2_, but the way on is a continuing traverse over the top of _Mig Country_.

### Mig Country to Mona tip -- NCB connection passage
The continuing _Mig Country_ traverse reaches another boulder floored spacious passage with a rope up on the far side.
This 20 m pit gains access to another wide, walking sized gallery, the Mona tip connection passages.
_Heading horizontally to the right at the pitch head leads back towards the connection point with M18_.
Heading downward and left reaches a wide, descending passage and after two traverses over deepening pits, a large junction is reached.
_A traverse line heading around a 50 m drop, followed by a rope up, leads back towards the Mona tip entrance._
To the left, another 50 m (_Extra Dunkel_) is found after just 20 m. It is possible to traverse over the pit to the left, gaining a short section of spacious gallery, ending at a boulder choke.
