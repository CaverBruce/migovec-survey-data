## Christmas Camp to My Little Pitch

### Christmas Camp to Death Star

After following the continuation of the passage on the far side of the camp, a 15 m pitch is found which drops into a wide and tall chamber: _Sweet Baby Jesus_. On the far side of this chamber, a junction is reached, with an ascending tube on the left and an inactive meander on the right (_Holy Moley_) (\numflag{5}{c3}). Take the route to the right.
A 6 m pitch leads to a short low section containing standing puddles of water, and beyond, a 15 m pitch drops into _Alabaster_.
After a series of small downclimbs and pitches lands in a chamber with two ways on (_Purgatory_).
Immediately on the right is a 5 m drop into the start of the _Bath_ pitch series (\numflag{6}{c3}).
_Ahead and beyond a rock pillar is a pit into the alternative way to_ Death Star _called_ Octarine.

In _Bath_, several small 5 m pitches separated by low sections eventually lead to a series of longer drops eventually landing in a chamber with a large pool of water, with a window on the opposite side (\numflag{7}{c3}). This window requires a short rope ascent, and is the connection to the _Octarine_ branch and it's continuation down into _Death Star_. To the right of this large passage is a low continuation leading to another pitch head (_Canticle for Migovec_), and the continuation of _Bath_.

After going up into the _Death Star_ window, a small climb left over boulders leads to a low continuation. A few short somewhat tight pitches follow, which drop into a phreatic tube that goes both left and right. Left is the way on, with right rejoining _Bath_ from a window. Following this around the left has a short crawling section, that then opens out into long series of pitches.

### Death Star to Delta Blues

The navigation from here to the beginning of _The Deep Awakens_ is very simple, and just consists of following the rope down through the series of Sith-named pitches. The next point of navigation is reached at a crawling height horizontal pitch-head that descends to a large chamber with a tall boulder at the bottom, labelled "The Dalek". This boulder is very loose and wobbly. After two short pitches from "The Dalek", a clear puddle about a metre deep is reached. Rounding to corner the left a rope is found, and a junction is reached (\numflag{8}{c3}) where the down rope goes to _Cantina Canyon_ and the up rope leads to _Delta Blues_.  

Warning - the route up to _Delta Blues_ is a loose boulder chamber and should be attempted one at a time. After following the rope up from the junction, follow the left hand wall to a handline / roped pitch with a single rebelay. The top of this reaches the _Delta Blues_ traverse. This is the point at which rope free should be called. 

### Delta Blues to Sparkle Junction

The _Delta Blues_ traverse follows a large phreatic tube above _Cantina Canyon_. This traverse ends in a pitch down to the left of the chamber, landing on a boulder half a metre above the floor. A small waterfall enters the chamber at this point, which must be run through to reach the way on. An up rope from this small chamber leads to _Blues and Twos_, but the way to _My Little Pitch_ is into the rift ahead. 

Staying high in the rift, about a metre off the floor, take the right hand turn and follow the rift for five to ten minutes. A traverse rope is found to the top of a pitch head down to _Discordant Bebop_, but the way on goes over the top of this to another pitch descending into a cross rift. Turn left at the bottom of this pitch, following the rope, and another short pitch drops into the large chamber (\numflag{9}{c3}) at the start of _Sparkle Junction_.

### Sparkle Junction to My Little Pitch

_Sparkle Junction_ is a roomy chamber at the start of _Sparkle Highway_, the obvious continuation on the far side of the chamber. This passage continues for about 50m until reaching the first pitch, which marks the start of _Pandora's Approach_. This passage continues on over large boulders, reaching another pitch before sloping down to reach a black slot in the right wall, the top of 90 m deep _My Little Pitch_. Extreme caution should be taken here due to loose rocks.

### My Little Pitch and Beyond

The ledge overlooking _My Little Pitch_, known as _The Balcony of the Equestrians_ is incredibly loose, and rocks knocked down here can hit rigging and cavers anywhere on or at the bottom of the large pitch below. Extreme caution should be taken here. 

At the bottom of _My Little Pitch_ there are three large boulders at least five metres in diameter. On the opposite side of the pitch to the rope is a scree slope down to a potential lead, which is very unsafe due to loose rocks. The way on is easy to miss, being on the same side as the rope, and starts as a two metre climb down, followed by a short crawl. 

Below the crawl is a two metre pitch into _Golden Ticket Chamber_. The floor slopes in all directions to a rift at the centre of this chamber, which can be descended from a large y-hang. This route leads to _Down the Rabbit Hole_. The other route from _Golden Ticket Chamber_ is on the opposite side from the entrance, where a short climb up a scree slope leads to a muddy passage, _Loompa Land_.
