<!-- ### Sejna Soba to Knot Very Good
The route is described in A Primadona-Monatip round trip: follow instructions to reach Sejna Soba from the Primadona entrance. At Sejna Soba, the way on is to the right when facing the water chamber. A climb down into a dry, stooping height gallery is followed by a couple of minutes of easy caving to the top of a small $2m$ drop. This is rigged and a larger 5m drop swings into a short stooping height, scalloped passage. The take-off of Knot Very Good is at the far end of the passage. The pitch starts as an elongate rift and bells out where the drips come in. The 20m hang lands on a bouldery floor of a $10 \times 10$m chamber with many ways off. Water disappears in between boulders to Cattlegrid, while a muddy tube near the landing leads to The Stile. A larger passage reached by scrambling on a muddy shelf marks the start of the Smer0 gallery.

### Knot Very Good to Rokovo Brezno
 Opposite Smer0, a large, draughty gallery leads off, via several dry chambers with muddy floors to a traverse over a drop. On the right hand wall, water comes in noisily from an aven above, cascading down Quantum State pitch. Traversing over the pitch head using the in-situ rope leads into an abandoned streamway rift.  The draughty passage continues past a $1^1/2$m drop onto a mud floor and develops as a sinuous dry rift which is best traversed near the bottom. At the next climb down, it is possible to climb to the roof of the passage and continue a traverse over the top of Rokovo Brezno. The way on is down a small climb to find the pitch head.

### Rokovo Brezno to the Hall of the Mountain King
 At the bottom of the clean 30m hang in a $9\times9$m circular shaft the start of Karstaway passage drops down several times to reach a small 4m drop into the Lunch Spot, where a small stream is joined. Upstream is a small 15m clean-washed aven with interesting mud sediments. Following the water downstream, walls come in to form a straight, tight rift, beyond which a waterfall joins the stream. At a larger water chamber, the passage is above the water in a small phreatic tube with clear scallops. Staying high and leaving the streamway leads to a series of scrambles over boulders along a white rift. The passage abruptly ends at the head of the Mighty Fine Indeed series of pitches (P20, P15, P43). The third pitch drops into the large Hall of the Mountain King chamber, a high, boulder strewn passage.

### Hall of the Mountain King to Upside Down Chamber
A scramble up a boulder slope on the far side of the chamber leads to a climb up into Colony, a horizontal passage, where a chilling draught is found again. In the passage, to the left and upwind is the start of What a Coincidence! passage while the way down through boulders, downwind, leads quickly to the head of the impressive Blue Danube pitch (P46). The pitch starts against the fault wall, and bells out 15m below, where a hanging rebelay provides a clean 30m hang down the $6x6m$ elegant shaft. Half-way through the descent, a swing lands on a steep mud-and-boulders slope reaching the centre of the impressive Upside Down Chamber ($20\times30\times40$m).

### Hall of the Mountain King to Ajdovščina
This begins as the upwind route labelled What a Coincidence! where, past a series of crawl connected muddy chambers, another constriction leads to a pitch head on the right-hand side. A traverse on the left gains the start of  a spacious phreatic passage with a vadose trench in the floor. This passage bends to the left, with an aven taking a trickle of water on the left. Further along, a Y-hang pitch drops into a larger chamber on top a very prominent large boulder in the centre. On the far side of the chamber another set of ropes allow the return journey via Ajdovščina and the TTT route. -->

### Sejna Soba to Povezava aven
A hole immediately opposite the entrance series entry point into Sejna Soba leads after a short constricted section into a stooping height passage.
Along the way, some peculiar smooth rounded boulders and a white flour texture on the walls is in evidence: this passage is called _Mlinotest_.
After some 50 m of easy going passage, a junction is reached, with the obvious continuation (to the right) soon leading to an unrigged pitch.
Instead, climbing up and ahead leads to a continuation of this passage, past some standing pools of water and a sharp left turn to wide ledge overlooking a climb down into _Povezava_ aven.


### Povezava aven to Manđare
Descending into _Povezava_ aven, the way on is at floor level, on the opposite side.
The floor soon drops and progress is achieved by traversing with the aid of protruding ledges to the level of a large choked block, beyond which the passage widens further.
Climbing down just before the block leads back to the floor level of the rift passage, and after another short downclimb, the passage widens again, with the floor dropping away once more.
A handline invites a climb up into a walking sized passage containing peculiar speleothems and the occasional haematite sand.
The passage briefly bifurcates and staying on the right, a small inlet of water is reached.
The water spouts into a chamber of modest size with a small pool of water, whose overflow disappears into a crack and falls into another pool.
On the far side of this chamber, a handline can be followed all the way to four-ways junction of _Manđare_ (\numflag{3}{c2}).

### Manđare to TTT

The way to _TTT_ is found opposite the entry point, traversing over a large, flat topped boulder with a cairn.

*To the left is a drop into a drippy, boulder floored chamber and further downclimbing leads back to the water seen previously, disappearing into a crack. To the right leads quickly to a high aven and a continuing passage on the far side, believed to loop back to Stara Jama*

The correct way on passes a short traverse  and a rigged downclimb to a lower level of the rift.
Some 20 m further on, a short 10 m descent is followed by a rigged handline up a greasy slope into dry passage.
Immediately following this climb up, another down climb leads to a wide dog-leg and a floor level constriction.
After the squeeze, a climb down on ledges leads to a short sideways walking section ending with a bifurcation.
Continuing down and ahead past a constriction, the traverse line ropes of _TTT_ are reached.
At the bottom of this 40 m pitch, split in the middle by a hanging rebelay, a large pendulum lands next a huge fallen block.

### TTT to Camp Manger

Beyond the very large fallen block in the middle of the _TTT_ pitch,  a small hole between bedrock and boulders can be found.
After this short climb through boulders, a 5 m pitch is reached, followed by a very short section of walking passage and beyond a corner, another 5 m roped pitch lands in the middle of _Camp Manger_.
This chamber is a T-junction, with the downstream continuation leading to the deeper parts of Primadona.
Upstream, a short climb leads into _Déjà Vu_ passage and the Hammerhead extensions.
