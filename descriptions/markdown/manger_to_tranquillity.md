## Camp Manger to Tranquillity

The main route between _Camp Manger_ (-350 m) and _Tranquillity Base_ (-650 m) is described hereafter.


### Camp Manger to Pivnica

Downstream of Camp Manger a short 1 m drop onto a wet mud bank is followed by a rigged traverse line over ledges, with the floor gradually dropping away.
Soon the pitch head of _Ajdovščina_ is reached (\numflag{1}{c4}).
The first drop lands on wide ledge, with a traverse leading away from the drips.
Further drops lead to a rebelay with a rope leading into a small window, which connects into _What a Coincidence!_ passage.
Staying in the main pitch, a pendulum reaches yet another ledge, and a final 20 m drop completes the descent of Ajdovcina, into a chamber containing one huge fallen boulder.
Staying first on the right hand-side of the chamber, a way underneath this large block leads to a short drop and crawl underneath blocks to the sound of water and a pitch head, the start of _Pivnica_.
