## Mary's Café to Hallelujah streamway

The following description covers the complex passages between the rest-stop at _Mary's Café_ and the breakthrough to the _Hallelujah_  extensions.

### Mary's Café to Knot Very Good
From the rest stop at _Mary's Cafe_, a 50 m long stooping to walking passage heading south leads to the top of a 5 m drop to a ledge.
Beyond the ledge, another drop with a deviation on the opposite wall allows a short 7-8 m descent ending with a swing into a short horizontal passage.
Some 20 m further, a 30 m pitch beckons, starting with an elongated cross-section.
After a deviation a couple of metres down, the drop directly leads into _Knot Very Good_ pitch (\numflag{1}{c3}).
The landing is located some metres above the floor of the chamber, on a terraced ledge.
On the opposite side of this ledge, a short traverse line leads into a muddy, walking sized passage, the start of _Smer0_.

*Unclipping onto the ledge, it is then possible to clamber over boulders into the main Knot Very Good chamber, and continue onwards to Galerija, a walking-sized gallery containing impressive sedimentary deposits on ledges. The gallery ends at a traverse over an unstable pitch head. Down leads to Quantum State, across the traverse leads to the start of Karstaway, and the pitch series to the Hall of the Mountain King.*


### Knot very Good to Fenestrator

Some 30 m along _Smer0_ passage, a short 3 m downclimb or alternatively, a rigged pitch leads to a continuation of the same passage.
Soon after and beyond a short narrowing of the passage, a climb down a mud bank leads to an important junction with a large, sediment filled gallery to the right, and a muddy crawl to the left (\numflag{2}{c3}).


*The large gallery is is the beginning of Smer0 passage, a passage with white ceiling and layered mud floor, partly entrenched. Soon, a climb up the mud banks (up, to the left) is encountered. Beyond is the continuation of Smer0 passage.*


Five metres along the muddy crawl, a complex junction of small, crawl passage ways is found (_the Stile_). Immediately to the right is a downclimb and short 5 m pit into a chamber with a bedrock floor.
At the bottom of this pit, the passage continues downwards past shallow pools, with a low ceiling and the occasional rock pillar.
Deeper pools follow soon after and past a small inlet (_Cattlegrid_), a 10 m pitch, _Fenestrator_, is found.

### Fenestrator to Plumber's Paradise
At the bottom of the rope, a short pendulum gives access to a narrow, rectilinear rift passage.
As soon as this opens into a larger space, the way on is a short slide down into a hole on the left.
Immediately after this constriction, an obscure right turn leads to the head of _Plumber's Paradise_ pitch (\numflag{3}{c3}).
At the bottom, following the rigged ropes leads into a high level ledge above a rift passage.
The constricted take off is followed by a short traverse over a 5 m pit leading to a pool of standing water.
On the far side of the traverse, an opening into a muddy horizontal passage beckons.

### Plumber's Paradise to Sweet Baby Jesus

_Plumber's Paradise_ branches off in the middle into two alternative and equivalent ways.
After about 50 m of variously crawling and stooping passage a ledge overlooking a climb down into _Hallelujah_ streamway is reached.
Downstream continues for about 100 m, past some potholes and short cascade sections.
In a widening bend of the passage, a rope leads upwards into the dry continuation of this branch (\numflag{4}{c3}).

*Ignoring this rope, a series of downclimbs following the water lead to* Beam me Up, *a series of hydrologically active pitches.*

A short down-climb leads to a 10 mpitch into a wide and tall chamber: _Sweet Baby Jesus_.

### Sweet Baby Jesus to Death Star
On the far side of this chamber, a junction is reached, with an ascending tube on the left and an inactive meander on the right (_Holy Moley_) (\numflag{5}{c3}).
Passing some rippled sand banks, a 6 m pitch leads to a short low section containing standing puddles of water, at the far end of which a 15 m pitch drops into _Alabaster_ passage.
After a series of small 2-3 m drops, another pitch (15 m + 6 m, _Purgatory_) lands in a chamber with a choice of ways.
Immediately on the right is a 5 m drop into the start of the _Bath_ pitch series (\numflag{6}{c3}).

_Ahead and beyond a rock pillar is a pit into the alternative way to_ Death Star _called_ Octarine.

In _Bath_, several small 5 m pitches separated by low sections eventually lead to a series of longer drops eventually landing in a chamber with a large pool of water, with a window on the opposite side (\numflag{7}{c3}).
To the right is a low passage leading to another pitch head (_Canticle for Migovec_), and the deepest passages of the Hallelujah branch.
Going up into the window leads into the connection with _Octarine_ and the way on to _Death Star_.
