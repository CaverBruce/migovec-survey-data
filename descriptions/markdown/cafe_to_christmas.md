## Mary's Café to Christmas Camp

### Mary's Café to Knot Very Good

From the rest stop at _Mary's Cafe_, a 50 m long stooping to walking passage heading south leads to the top of a 5 m drop to a ledge.
Beyond the ledge, another drop with a deviation on the opposite wall allows a short 7-8 m descent ending with a swing into a short horizontal passage.
Some 20 m further, a 30 m pitch beckons, starting with an elongated cross-section: _Knot Very Good_ pitch (\numflag{1}{c3}).
At the bottom, a short traverse line leads into a muddy, walking-sized passage, the start of _Smer0_.
_On the opposite side, another walking-sized gallery containing impressive sedimentary deposits on ledges leads to the_ Galerija _branch_

### Knot very Good to Fenestrator

Some 30 m along _Smer0_ passage, a short 3 m downclimb or alternatively, a rigged pitch leads to a continuation of the same passage.
Soon after and beyond a short narrowing of the passage, a climb down a mud bank leads to an important junction with a large, sediment-filled gallery to the right, and a muddy crawl to the left (\numflag{2}{c3}).
_The large gallery is the beginning of Smer0 passage, a passage with white ceiling and layered mud floor, partly entrenched. Soon, a climb up the mud banks (up, to the left) is encountered. Beyond is the continuation of Smer0 passage._
Five metres along the muddy crawl, a complex junction of small passages is found (_The Stile_) with a sharp right turn into a downclimb and rigged 5 m pitch.
At the bottom, the passage continues downwards past shallow pools, with a low ceiling and the occasional rock pillar.
Deeper pools follow soon after and past a small inlet (_Cattlegrid_), a 10 m pitch, _Fenestrator_, is found.

### Fenestrator to Plumber's Paradise

At the bottom of the rope, a short pendulum gives access to a narrow rift after which the way on is a short slide down into a hole on the left.
Immediately after this constriction, an obscure right turn leads to the head of _Plumber's Paradise_ pitch (\numflag{3}{c3}).
At the bottom, the ropes lead into a high-level ledge above a rift passage which, after a constricted pitch head, leads into a muddy horizontal passage.

### Plumber's Paradise to Christmas Camp

_Plumber's Paradise_ branches off in the middle into two alternative and equivalent ways.
After about 50 m of variously crawling and stooping passage a ledge overlooking a climb down into _Hallelujah_ streamway is reached.
Downstream continues for about 100 m, past some potholes and short cascade sections.
In a widening bend of the passage, a rope leads upwards into the dry continuation of this branch (\numflag{4}{c3}).
_Ignoring this rope, a series of downclimbs following the water lead to_ Beam me Up, _a series of hydrologically active pitches often referred to as "the wet lead"._
After the rope up, a short section of narrow but walking height passage ends in a short 5m rope, dropping into a cosy, sandy-floored chamber, _Christmas Camp_.
