## Brezno pod vrhom Planje

### Access

1. Starting from the Bivi, it is necessary to hike to the top of Tolminski Kuk and descend on the far side, using the marked hiking trail. Arriving at the saddle between Planja and Kuk, a short traverse on the southern slopes of Planja, at an altitude of 1900 m leads to a grassy expanse between a 70 m high cliff side to the south and the ridge leading to Planja to the north.
Near one of the sparse dwarf pine stands lies a 7 m deep shake hole, the entrance of the cave Brezno pod vrhom Planje.

2. Starting from Planina Kal and using the path towards Krn which stays along the 1500 m contour, one crosses several gullies, passes a small niche with a statue of Mary, and eventually arrives underneath Tolmninski Kuk.
Where the path turns west, a few large fallen boulders on the path mark the spot where a faint path has been cleared through dwarf pine, the beginning of the ascent.
Steep zig-zags reach a first scree slope at the top of which is a 20 m high limestone wall.
Skirting on the western (left side going up), a few steps up give access to another scree-filled bowl-shaped valley.
The 70 m cliff below Planja is ahead, and again the way up is past a large 20 m diameter shakehole (Bertijeva Jama), and up on the western (left) side of the cliff along a grassy ramp.
Accessing the grassy slope below Planja, the cave is located about 100 m in the direction of Kuk, by one of the rare dwarf pine clumps.
