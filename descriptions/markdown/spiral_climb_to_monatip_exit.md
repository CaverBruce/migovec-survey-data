## Spiral Climb to Monatip Exit

The following description enables the navigation of the connection between Primadona and Mona tip entrances.
The passages between the Primadona-entrance and the Spiral climb are described in the 'Drugi Vhod' section.

### Spiral Climb to Alkatraz chamber

At this point, a climb up on the right-hand side (_The Rock_) leads up several metres into the roof of the passage (\numflag{1}{c5}).
Following the rope up, an upwards constriction between boulders gives access to a small, boulder floored chamber.
On the far side is an opening to a steep, muddy slope descending into the western end of the very large _Alkatraz_ chamber.
The way on is up the opposite side of this chamber, going up above a stack of large fallen boulders, to the foot of a permanently rigged pitch.
_Ignoring the rope, the uppermost part of the chamber connects with a small rift passage heading both up ( towards_ Mona tip _) and down ( towards_ Sejna Soba _)._

### Alkatraz to Cloaca Maxima crawl

At the top of the rope (30 m pitch), a crawl leads off into a 30 m tall dry aven (\numflag{2}{c5}).
The continuation of the crawl is found 5 m above floor level on the opposite side.
Reaching this crawl with the in-situ handline, the passage turns abruptly to the left at a T-junction (to the right is a smaller aven climbed for 10 m, continuing).
The way on is to the left, finding a bifurcation after 20 m, with two crawling-sized passages leading off (\numflag{3}{c5}).
_To the left, the crawl ascends to a pitch head, the start of a short pitch series (_ Well Hung _), which reconnects with the original Mona tip passage leading to Alkatraz._

### Cloaca Maxima to Planika chamber

To the right is the continuation of _Cloaca Maxima_, a long ascending crawl.
First a sharp right turn, followed by a left turn lead to a short down-climb into a mud-floored chamber (\numflag{4}{c5}).
The crawl resumes after short climb back up on the opposite side.
Ascending linearly for approximately 50 m, the crawl pops out into a small chamber.
Beyond is a sharp right turn opening into a rift with a traverse line spanning the passage.
_This rift is the main Mona tip passage, leading downwards back to_ Alkatraz _chamber._

Following this rope, an almost complete U-turn and squeeze between boulders leads to a birfurcation (\numflag{5}{c5}).
To the right is a short muddy passage (_Aleksandrija_) whose end is unexplored .
Ahead is another squeeze opening at the base of a boulder slope, in _Planika_ chamber.

### Planika chamber to Mona tip exit

_Planika_ chamber represents the main fork in Mona tip passages, with a bolt-climb accessing high level horizontal passages connecting with M-18.
On the far side of the chamber, a rift passage leads to a short roped traverse and a series of up/down pitches (\numflag{6}{c5}).
The final rope up enters a draughty, cobble-floored crawling-sized tube (\numflag{7}{c5}), which descends gently to a grassy ledge by the entrance of Mona tip.
