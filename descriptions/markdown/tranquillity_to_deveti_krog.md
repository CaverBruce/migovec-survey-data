## Tranquillity base to Deveti Krog

### Klic Globin to Artemis

On the western side at the bottom of the Klic Globin is the beginning of a short horizontal passage. On the western wall, a climb down through boulders leads down to a narrow pitch head: this is the beginning of Artemis passage, a steeply sloping tall passage leading down to the sound of a waterfall. 

### Artemis to Street-wise Hercules

Drop down the ropes through a constriction to a pitch split halfway by a wet ledge. At the bottom, the passage takes a turn to the north, near the water. Poseidon rift begins with a roped constriction near the water level, followed by two short pitches into a high chamber. On the far side is a boulder collapse under which the water is rejoined: the beginning of Street-Wise Hercules. 

### Street-wise Hercules to Deveti Krog

Follow the ropes down a short pitch, then up and across a narrow traverse, before popping out over a very deep rift. Follow the rebelays all the way down Hades, and Angels Falls. It is very wet.
