## Drugi Vhod to Mary's Cafe

### Surface abseil
The surface abseil of Primadona begins in a shallow valley at the USTART way point. Several rebelays on a high angle grass and scree slope lead to a lip of rock next to a prominent rock spire, which is crowned by a lightning struck bush of dwarf pine. The spire overhangs the second, more vertical part of the descent: a series of rebelays landing on various rock ledges, which eventually drop by the entrance snow slope of Primadona. A traverse line leading north stops short of the Monatip entrance, which lies just around the next rocky ridge, 70 m away. Two ways into the gaping entrance of Primadona can be followed: _Drugi Vhod_ (\numflag{1}) is the high level climb into a black void, while the original entrance is found at the bottom of the snow slope.

### Belladonna to Bear Pitch
Belladonna entrance is a short pendulum below the hanging rebelay in the surface abseil.
The swing leads to a short descending tube and pitch head. Following two drops, the _Drugi vhod_ entrance chamber is reached (\numflag{1}).
A short, draughty crawl leads past a first pitch head, but the way on is a parallel pitch beyond a short traverse.
Following the first drop, a ledge where the rope is deviated lands on a steep boulder climb down to a narrow pitch head.
Below this drop is a short traverse, followed by a deviated rope and a landing on a steeply inclined bedrock ramp.
At the bottom of this pitch, a junction with the original entrance series is found (\numflag{2}), but the way on is the beckoning pitch head.

### Bear Pitch to Spiral Climb
_Bear Pitch_ is split near the top by a rebelay avoiding rub on a large ledge. The rope drops into a boulder floor chamber where a bear skeleton was discovered in the early 2000's. A carbide mark (+M) notes the place where they were found. A short traverse leads to the next drop (P15). This leads into a larger fault controlled cavern: a traverse on ledges leads to a Y-hang to reach the floor. This is followed by two short downclimbs where calcite encrusted fossils stick out of the black rock. Soon after, a window at the base of the left hand wall reveals a boulder chamber, the _Spiral Climb_ (\numflag{3}), but the way is in the rift, and around two massive boulders by keeping to the right hand wall in a corkscrew fashion.

_At this point, a climb up on the right-hand side leads up several metres into the roof.  A constricted rope up between boulders pops out into a small, boulder floored chamber. On the far side is an opening to a steep, muddy slope descending into the western end of_ Alkatraz _chamber._

### Spiral Climb to Risanke

Below the boulders, and under a small drip, a descending rift of small dimensions leads to the next pitch, with a rebelay rigged of a nose of rock protruding from the wall. At the bottom, a small down-climb lands next to a drip spot with water collecting bottles. Beyond lies a small but complex chamber with paper note, _Lost and Found_ junction (\numflag{4}).

_From_ Lost and Found _junction, a rope leads upwards into a seldom visited branch of Primadona called_ Stara Jama _which reconnects into the main passages at Manđare junction._

### Risanke to Sejna Soba
At _Lost and Found_ junction, the way on is to the left under a rock overhang, through a constriction showing signs of blasting (_Risanke_). The rigged down-climb drops in to a boulder strewn chamber and further pitch with a traverse around a corner onto a wide ledge completes the descent. From this ledge, the cairned way through the chaotic boulder collapse allows access to a larger, boulder strewn aven. Following traverse ropes on the left leads to a narrow rift where progress is made by sideways crawling. After popping out in another smaller aven chamber, the constricted way carries until the breakthrough into _Sejna Soba_, another complex junction with a window into a loudly dripping water chamber.

### Sejna Soba to Mary's Cafe
From _Sejna Soba_, clambering through a window to the sound of water leads to a ledge overlooking the water chamber. Immediately to the right, a downclimb into a mud-covered, draughty passage leads to a small recess out of the wind. This is Mary's Café.
