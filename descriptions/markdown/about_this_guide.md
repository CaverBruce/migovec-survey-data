## Selected trips under the Hollow Mountain

With 44\,km in length at the time of writing, System Migovec is a major Alpine system of NW Slovenia.
It ranks among the 100 longest worldwide, a remarkable feat after more than forty years of dedicated expeditions.
The description of every metre of this cave is impossible as countless recesses, cracks, indomitable crawls or squeezes saw the light of one or two cavers, who, running low on energy and motivation, decided that "that was it".

Such passages may not be visited again in years, or indeed ever, as focus shifts towards other "leads", and will remain intact, but for the single track of footprints that bears witness to the presence of one explorer.
Such passages may endure within memory as traces on a larger map or a name in a directory.
Others will become highways, passed by many explorers en route to the business end of the cave: pitches, galleries, streamways, they bear the mark of our presence: ropes, footprints, anchors.

## About this Guide

To assist the visiting caver unfamiliar with the complex navigation of Migovec, a series of descriptions from key passages are given in this book.
Each double page contains both a plan-view map of a highlighted route and its corresponding description.
The plan view maps also displays some connecting passages which may also be of interest for a short visit.
The description of such excursions from the main route are given in *italics* in the text.
