Facing towards primadoni direction hare cave is on the left side of the shake hole. Basically you are standing above postcard cave. It is in a smaller shakhole behind you. The entrance is a very low thin bedding plane that immediately breaks into an 'impressive' entrance phreatic tube with a choked draughting rift in the floor. This looks like many other entrances, so the way to confirm is that keyhole cave should also be present in the shakehole. Still facing the same way (i.e. away from the shakehole towards the hare cave shakehole), keyhole cave is on the left side and is almost completely invisible unless you are standing in exactly the right place. Entrance is a lovely phreatic keyhole about 1m high and really very hidden. The cave follows this shape for a couple of metres before ending in a choked small chamber.

    "  - \"Keyhole cave and postcard cave are very near the bivvy. The easiest way to describe them is to start from the edge of the shakehole with hare cave in. Facing towards primadoni direction hare cave is on the left side of the shake hole. Basically you are standing above postcard cave. It is in a smaller shakhole behind you. The entrance is a very low thin bedding plane that immediately breaks into an 'impressive' entrance phreatic tube with a choked draughting rift in the floor. This looks like many other entrances, so the way to confirm is that keyhole cave should also be present in the shakehole. Still facing the same way (i.e. away from the shakehole towards the hare cave shakehole), keyhole cave is on the left side and is almost completely invisible unless you are standing in exactly the right place. Entrance is a lovely phreatic keyhole about 1m high and really very hidden. The cave follows this shape for a couple of metres before ending in a choked small chamber. Not that interesting but a great entrance - would make a superb start to a trip\"\n",
