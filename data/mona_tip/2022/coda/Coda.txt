station 32 is pss.
station 34 onwards is singing rock resurvey

Matti, James W, 22/07/22 Checked 3D survey, no survey of singing rock exists,
so this is the first survey

Coda survey includes singing rock, extends down below into 'Coda' passage

Survey stations are only even numbers for unkown reasons

Ends in tight crawl, does draft, passable with determination

Stn. 1 or 2 is a pss marked with a mars bar wrapper on a cairn - we left the paper behind.
