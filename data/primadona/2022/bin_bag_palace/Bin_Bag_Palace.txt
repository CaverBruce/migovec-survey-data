stn 19 is echo Falls stn 1

Additional comments from 28/07/2022 by AT:
Due to a lack of survey paper, no paper PSSs have been left. Instead station 0 is a clump of mud on a cairn with a "0" cut into it. Station 10 is a rock with "10" written on it in sharpie. No nail polish was available for marking survey stations either.
Paper PSSs should be left at next oppotunity.
There are multiple possible leads off bin_bag_palace. Other than the obvious continuation down a short pitch at stn 0, the most obvious way on is a cross rift at stn 13 with walking sized passage and a short up climb to the West. Other possible leads are at various pitch heads and involve climbing upwards (preferably on rope). There is also a tight-ish lead at the top of bin_bag_palace / bottom of echo_falls.
