station 43 of sparkle highway is station 21 of delta blues at bottom of upclimb. 

There was a mistake so the PSS that we labeled as 28 is actually 29. there is no issue with the other numbering. 

} up pitch from large room leads to ascending rift, needs traverse line bolting. probably links with weird squeeze on left. 
} sparkle highway inactive stream way ends in false floor pitch (strawberry shortcake). needs heavy gardening but ceiling bolts very possible. 
} climb over strawberry shortcake to continue along stream way.
